BPI2015: DutchMunicipalities

Event Logs taken from five Dutch municipalities.

The data contains all building permit applications over a period of approximately four years. There are many different activities present, denoted by both codes (attribute conceptName) and labels, both in Dutch (attribute taskNameNL / REMOVED) and in English (attribute taskNameEN).

The cases in the log contain information on the main application as well as objection procedures in various stages. Furthermore, information is available about the resource that carried out the task and on the cost of the application (attribute SUMleges).

The processes in the five municipalities should be identical, but may differ slightly. Especially when changes are made to procedures, rules or regulations the time at which these changes are pushed into the five municipalities may differ. Of course, over the four year period, the underlying processes have changed.

The municipalities have a number of questions, outlined below:

1. What are the roles of the people involved in the various stages of the process and how do these roles differ across municipalities?
2. What are the possible points for improvement on the organizational structure for each of the municipalities?
The employees of two of the five municipalities have physically moved into the same location recently. Did this lead to a change in the processes and if so, what is different?
3. Some of the procedures will be outsourced from 2018, i.e. they will be removed from the process and the applicant needs to have these activities performed by an external party before submitting the application. What will be the effect of this on the organizational structures in the five municipalities?
4. Where are differences in throughput times between the municipalities and how can these be explained?
5. What are the differences in control flow between the municipalities?

#### Original Data

There are five different log files available. Events are labeled with both a code and a Dutch and English label. Each activity code consists of three parts: two digits, a variable number of characters, and then three digits. The first two digits as well as the characters indicate the subprocess the activity belongs to. For instance ‘01_HOOFD_xxx’ indicates the main process and ‘01_BB_xxx’ indicates the ‘objections and complaints’ (‘Beroep en Bezwaar’ in Dutch) subprocess. The last three digits hint on the order in which activities are executed, where the first digit often indicates a phase within a process.

Some statistics on the logs:

- Log 1: 1199 cases, 52217 events, 398 event classes, 10.4121/uuid:a0addfda-2044-4541-a450-fdcc9fe16d17. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.
- Log 2: 832 cases, 44354 events, 410 event classes, 10.4121/uuid:63a8435a-077d-4ece-97cd-2c76d394d99c. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.
- Log 3: 1409 cases, 59681 events, 383 event classes, 10.4121/uuid:ed445cdd-27d5-4d77-a1f7-59fe7360cfbe. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.
- Log 4: 1053 cases, 47293 events, 356 event classes, 10.4121/uuid:679b11cf-47cd-459e-a6de-9ca614e25985. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.
- Log 5: 1156 cases, 59083 events, 398 event classes, 10.4121/uuid:b32c6fe5-f212-4286-9774-58dd53511cf8. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.

Each trace and each event, contain several data attributes that can be used for various checks and predictions. Furthermore, some employees may have performed tasks for different municipalities, i.e. if the employee number is the same, it is safe to assume the same person is being identified.

The entire collection can be found under DOI: 10.4121/uuid:31a308ef-c844-48da-948c-305d167a0ec1

#### Data Transformation:

1. The data from event logs was pre-processed to remove dimensions with missing values in more 50% of records;
2. The taskNameNL (Dutch) attribute was removed as it is presented in English;
3. A column "duration" was included with the time in hours between events;
4. A column "durationClass" was included with the binary values of "low" and "high", where the logs are classified as high when duration between the first to last event is more than median duration plus two standard deviations (based on all dataset events).
5. A column "label" was added with the number corresponding to the municipality
