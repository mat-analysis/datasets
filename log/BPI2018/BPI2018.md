BPI2018: PaymentCommonAgriculturalPolicy

Event Logs taken from a German company.

The European Union spends a large fraction of its budget on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Among these spendings are direct payments, which are mainly aimed to provide a basic income for farmers decoupled from production. The rest of the CAP budget is spent for market related expenditures and rural development. The processes that govern the distribution of these funds are subject to complex regulations captured in EU and national law. The member states are required to operate an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), which includes IT systems to support the complex processes of subsidy distribution. The process considered in this dataset covers the handling of applications for EU direct payments for German farmers from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. The process repeats every year with minor changes due to changes in EU regulations. The dataset is extracted from the systems of data experts, Germany. Their tool profil c/s supports these processes at the level of federal ministries of agriculture and local departments. The workflows in profil c/s can be understood in terms of documents, where each document has a state that allows for certain actions. These actions can be executed manually at any point in time through document specific tools or they can be scheduled automatically. The latter may be either explicitly stated in the log or implicitly apparent if a large number of actions is performed by the same user at around the same time (batch processing). In total, the event log contains 2,514,266 events for 43,809 applications over a period of three years. The shortest case contains 24 events, the longest 2973 and on average there are 57 events per case referring to 14 activities.

The data for this year's challenge is brought to you by the German company data experts, located in Neubrandenburg. They provide data from their Java Enterprise system profil c/s.

Profil c/s supports these processes at the level of federal ministries of agriculture and local departments. The system supports various kinds of administrative processes, but for this challenge, the focus is on the yearly allocation of direct payments, starting with the application and, if all goes well, finishing with the authorization of a payment.

The shortest case contains 24 events, the longest 2973 and on average there are 57 events per case referring to 14 activities. As mentioned, the data is centered around documents and for your convenience, we provide both the complete log file as well as log files for each document type, in which each instance of a document is a case. We expect to publish the data in the 4TU datacenter soon!

There are nine different document types in the data listed in the table below. From 2015 to 2016, the Parcel document was succeeded by the Geo Parcel Document. In 2017, the Geo Parcel document also replaced the Department Control Parcels document.

For each document type, one or more sub-processes can be found in the data. These sub processes refer to the overall sequence of events that influence a document. The leading document is always an application for which a number of other documents are created. Typically, documents are created by the initialize activity. Then, documents are edited, typically shown by begin editing until finish editing or a similar pair. While editing, several things may be recorded, for example some calculations are made or the application is saved. The log shows the times at which these events are completed and there are considerable dependencies between the sub-activities of different documents. For example, you will usually only be able to decide an application after all the other documents are in a final state.

### Trace attributes

The following attributes are recorded for each case, where each case represent one application of one applicant in a specific year.

#### Data Transformation:

1. The data from event logs was pre-processed to remove dimensions with missing values in more 50% of records;
2. A column "duration" was included with the time in hours between events;
3. A column "label" was included with the binary values of "low" and "high", where the logs are classified as high when duration between the first to last event is more than median duration plus two standard deviations (based on all dataset events).
