BPI2012: DutchFinancial

Event Logs taken from a Dutch Financial Institute.

This log contains some 262.200 events in 13.087 cases. Apart from some anonymization, the log contains all data as it came from the financial institute. The process represented in the event log is an application process for a personal loan or overdraft within a global financing organization. The amount requested by the customer is indicated in the case attribute AMOUNT_REQ, which is global, i.e. every case contains this attribute. The event log is a merger of three intertwined sub processes. The first letter of each task name identifies from which sub process (source) it originated from. Feel free to run analyses on the process as a whole, on selections of the whole process and/or the individual sub processes.

The data owner is interested in all valuable information and especially estimators for the total cycle time, which resources generate the highest activation rate of applications, how does the process model look like, which decisions have great influence on the process flow and where are they.

The log is provided in XES format (3.3 MB) and in MXML format (5.3 MB). The XES format is a standard defined by the IEEE task force on process mining. For details on the XES format, please look here.

For referencing purposes, the log file has a DOI doi:10.4121/uuid:3926db30-f712-4394-aebc-75976070e91f and can be found in the 3TU Datacenter. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.

#### Data Transformation:

1. The data from event logs was pre-processed to remove dimensions with missing values in more 50% of records;
2. A column "duration" was included with the time in hours between events;
3. A column "label" was included with the binary values of "low" and "high", where the logs are classified as high when duration between the first to last event is more than median duration plus two standard deviations (based on all dataset events).
