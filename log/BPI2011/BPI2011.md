BPI2011: DutchAcademicHospital

Event Logs taken from a Dutch Academic Hospital.

This log contains some 150.000 events in over 1100 cases. Apart from some anonymization, the log contains all data as it came from the Hospital's systems. Each case is a patient of a Gynaecology department. The log contains information about when certain activities took place, which group performed the activity and so on. Many attributes have been recorded that are relevant to the process. Some attributes are repeated more than once for a patient, indicating that this patient went through different (maybe overlapping) phases, where a phase consists of the combination Diagnosis & Treatment.

The log is provided in XES format (2.3 MB), in MXML format (3.4 MB) and as a CSV file (1.9 MB). The XES format is a standard defined by the IEEE task force on process mining. For details on the XES format, please look here.

For referencing purposes, the log file has a DOI doi:10.4121/uuid:d9769f3d-0ab0-4fb8-803b-0d1120ffcf54 and can be found in the 3TU Datacenter. Please use this DOI in any reference to the dataset.


#### Data Transformation:

1. The data from event logs was pre-processed to remove dimensions with missing values in more 50% of records;
2. Some columns in the event log are spread in 6 or 15 columns, as Age that has Age, Age:1, ..., Age:5. These columns were aggregated in one column with the first non null value;
3. A column "Duration" was included with the time in hours between events;
4. A column "label" was included with the binary values of "low" and "high", where the logs are classified as high when duration between the first to last event is more than median duration plus two standard deviations (based on all dataset events).
