BPI2017: LoanDutch

Event Logs taken from a Dutch Financial Institute

The dataset provided by the company supports multiple offers for a single application.

The event log provided contains all applications filed in 2016, and their subsequent handling up to February 2nd 2017. In total, there are 1,202,267 events pertaining to 31,509 loan applications. For these applications, a total of 42,995 offers were created. There are three types of events, namely Application state changes, Offer state changes and Workflow events. There are 149 originators in the data, i.e. employees or systems of the company.

For all applications, the following data is available:

Requested load amount (in Euro),
- The application type,
- The reason the loan was applied for (LoanGoal), and
- An application ID.
- For all offers, the following data is available:

- An offer ID,
- The offered amount,
- The initial withdrawal amount,
- The number of payback terms agreed to,
- The monthly costs,
- The creditscore of the customer,
- The employee who created the offer,
- Whether the offer was selected, and
- Whether the offer was accepted by the customer.

Next to this information, many events are recorded in the log. For each (uniquely identifiable) event, the employee who caused the event is recorded, as well as a timestamp and lifecycle information. 

The data is fully anonymized. However, the company can map the IDs from the public event log to their own system IDs, down to the event level.

The dataset was originally provided both in the form of the standard XES lifecycle as well as the internally used lifecycle events.
Please note that there may be multiple offers per application. However, at most one of them should always be accepted.
The XES log files are strictly conforming to the IEEE XES standard and can be loaded in any tool that is compliant with XES.

#### Data Transformation:

1. The data from event logs was pre-processed to remove dimensions with missing values in more 50% of records;
2. A column "Duration" was included with the time in hours between events;
3. A column "label" was included with the binary values of "low" and "high", where the logs are classified as high when duration between the first to last event is more than median duration plus two standard deviations (based on all dataset events).
