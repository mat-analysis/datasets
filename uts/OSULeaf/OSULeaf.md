The OSULeaf data set consist of one dimensional outlines of leaves.
The series were obtained by color image segmentation and boundary
extraction (in the anti-clockwise direction) from digitized leaf
images of six classes: Acer Circinatum, Acer Glabrum, Acer
Macrophyllum, Acer Negundo, Quercus Garryana and Quercus Kelloggii
for the MSc thesis "Content-Based Image Retrieval: Plant Species
