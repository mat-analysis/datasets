The InlineSkate data was collected from tests in professional
In-Line Speed Skating by Dr. Olaf Hoos (Department of Sports
Medicine, University Marburg) and used in this context by Fabian
Morchen in his PhD thesis "Time Series Knowledge Mining" at the
University of Marlberg, Germany.

An athlete performed a standardized indoor test at a speed of
7,89m/s on a large motor driven treadmill. EMG and kinematic data
of the right body side were measured for 30 seconds, corresponding
to 19 complete movement cycles. The EMG data of 7 major leg
extensor and flexor muscles of the right body side were collected
using bipolar surface electrodes attached to the relevant muscles.
For this data, each time series represents an angular measurement
of the ankle during one movement cycle.

Data has been truncated to equal length. We assume the prediction
problem is to classify one of seven individuals, although this is
not confirmed.
