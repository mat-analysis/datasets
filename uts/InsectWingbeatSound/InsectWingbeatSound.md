The InsectWingbeatSound data was generated by the UCR computational
entomology group and used in the paper <em >Flying Insect
Classification with Inexpensive Sensors.</em> Journal of Insect
Behaviour 2014. The original data is a reconstruction of the sound
of insects passing through a sensor. The data in the archive is the
power spectrum of the sound. The 11 classes are male and female
mosquitos (Ae. aegypti, Cx. tarsalis, 	Cx. quinquefasciants, Cx.
stigmatosoma), two types of flies (Musca domestica and Drosophila
simulans) and other insects.

Efficient Mosquito classification has real world application that
could have far reaching effects. The data consists of ten sets of
5000 clean one second audio clips recorded using a pseudo acoustic
optical sensor. Data on both male and female mosquitos of four
species make up eight sets, the remaining sets are species of fly.
Data was donated by Eamonn Keogh, UCR. Detailed information on how
the insects were produced
