Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types,
a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality
assurance. The ham data includes measurements from 19 Spanish and
18 French dry-cured hams. Triplicate lanes of duplicate extractions
(giving ~6 data vectors per sample), pre-processed and aligned as
described in <em>“Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis of proteins in dry-cured hams: Data registration
and multivariate analysis across multiple gels”</em>, Olias R. et.
al., Electrophoresis 27 (7) 1288-1299.
