Dataset with multiple aspect trajectories from users around the world on the Gowalla  Location-Based Social Network (LSBN) \[1\]. It has the same dimensions as the Brightkite dataset, with check-in trajectories of the anonymized user. From this dataset we also split the trajectories weekly and extracted a total of 300 random users for analysis, while limiting the trajectory sizes for a minimum of 10 and maximun of 50 points. The check-in points were also enriched with the semantic information of the weekday in each check-in. The resultant dataset has a total of 5,329 trajectories, 98,158 check-ins, with trajectory sizes varying from 10 to 50 points.
