Dataset from the Foursquare social media with multiple aspect trajectories in New York \[1\]. The points were enriched with the semantic information of the weekday, and the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)  enabled to collect the semantic information of the POI category, and the numerical information of the price and rating of the POIs. Indeed, the [Weather Wunderground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) enabled to enrich the points with the weather situation. The resultant dataset has a total of 3,079 trajectories, with trajectory sizes varying from 10 to 144.
