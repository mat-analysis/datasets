GECCO Industrial Challenge: 'Internet of Things: Online Anomaly Detection for Drinking Water Quality'

Description:

For the 7th time in GECCO history, the SPOTSeven Lab is hosting an industrial challenge in cooperation with various industry partners. This years challenge, based on the 2017 challenge, is held in cooperation with "Thüringer Fernwasserversorgung" which provides their real-world data set. The task of this years competition is to develop an anomaly detection algorithm for the water- and environmental data set. Early identification of anomalies in water quality data is a challenging task. It is important to identify true undesirable variations in the water quality. At the same time, false alarm rates have to be very low.
Additionally to the competition, for the first time in GECCO history we are now able to provide the opportunity for all participants to submit 2-page algorithm descriptions for the GECCO Companion. Thus, it is now possible to create publications in a similar procedure to the Late Breaking Abstracts (LBAs) directly through competition participation!
