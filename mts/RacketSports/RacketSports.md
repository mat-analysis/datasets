The data was created by university students plyaing badminton or squash whilst wearing a smart watch (Sony Smart watch 35). The watch relayed the x-y-z coordinates for
both the gyroscope and accelerometer to an android phone (One Plus 56). The phone
wrote these values to an Attribute-Relation File Format (arff) file using an app developed
by a UEA computer science masters student. The problem is to identify which sport and which stroke the players are making. The data was collected at a rate of 10 HZ over 3 seconds whilst the player played
either a forehand/backhand in squash or a clear/smash in badminton.
The data was collected as part of an undergraduate project by Phillip Perks in 2017/18.
