%Caenorhabditis elegans is a roundworm commonly used as a model organism in the study of genetics. The movement of these worms is known to be a useful 
%indicator for understanding behavioural genetics. Brown {\em et al.}[1] describe a system for recording the motion of worms on an agar plate and 
%measuring a range of human-defined features[2].  It has been shown that the space of shapes Caenorhabditis elegans adopts on an agar plate can be 
%represented by combinations of six base shapes, or eigenworms. Once the worm outline is extracted, each frame of worm motion can be captured by six
%scalars representing the amplitudes along each dimension when the shape is projected onto the six eigenworms. Using data collected for the work described 
%in[1],  we address the problem of classifying individual worms as wild-type or mutant based on the time series. The data were extracted from the C. elegans behavioural database
%[3].
%We have 259 cases, which we split 131 train and 128 test. We have truncated each series to the shortest usable. Each series has 17984 observations. 
%Each worm is classified as either wild-type (the N2 reference strain) or one of four mutant types: 
%goa-1; unc-1; unc-38 and unc-63.
