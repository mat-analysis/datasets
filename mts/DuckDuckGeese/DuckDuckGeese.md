Duck Duck Geese Description:
This data set was derived from recordings found on www.xenocanto.com. Each recording was taken from either the A or B quality catagory. Due to the variation in recorded sample rate all recordings were downsampled to 44100Hz using Matlabs resample function.
Each recording was then center truncated to 5 seconds (length of smallest recording), before being tansformed into a spectogram using a window size of 0.061 and an overlap value of 70%.
The classes are as follows:
