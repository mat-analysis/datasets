Phoneme Description:
This data set is a multivaritate representation of a subset of the data used in the paper Dual-domain Hierarchical Classification of Phonetic Time Series. 
In the case of the raw data.
Each series was extracted from the segmented audio collected from Google Translate
Audio files collected from Google translate are recorded at 22050
The speakers are male and female.
After data collection, they segment waveforms of the words to generate phonemes using the Forced Aligner tool from the Penn Phonetics Laboratory.
A Spectrogram of each instance was then created with a window size of 0.001 seconds and an overlap of 90%.
Each instance in this multivariate dataset is arranged such that each dimension is a frequency band from the spectrogram.
The data consists of 39 classes each with 170 instances.
